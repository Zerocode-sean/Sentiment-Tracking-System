 CHAPTER ONE: RESEARCH OVERVIEW  
 
1.1 Statement of Problem  
Many brands struggles to effectively monitor and analyze user sentiment across 
various platforms such as social media, review sites and customer feedback 
channels. The absence of a centralized, real -time sentiment tracking system often 
leads to delayed res ponses to negative feedback, missed opportunities to engage 
with customers, and inability to identify emerging trends or issues. For a specific 
brand of product, the lack of a robust sentiment tracking system results to 
challenges like, inability to gauge customer sentiment accurately, delay response to 
negative feedback, missed opportunities for positive engagement, difficulty  in 
identifying trends and also manual analysis is time consuming and inefficient.  
 
1.2 Study Justification  
A User Sentiment Tracking System is vital for a brand to monitor and analyze 
customer feedback in real time. This study is justified as it enables the brand to 
improve customer satisfaction, proactively manage its reputation and make data 
driven decisions.  By automating sentiment analysis, the brand can efficiently scale 
its efforts, stay ahead of competitors, and align with industry trends. Implementing 
such a system ensures the brand remains responsive to customer needs, enhances 
its products, and maintai ns a competitive edge in the market. The study will aim  
me with sufficient knowledge which will help me get prepare to develop the 
platform in the coming semester as my end of diploma project  
 
1.3 Research Objectives  
 
1.3.1 General Objective  
  (i)To develop a user sentiment tracking system for brand or product.  
1.3.2 Specific Objectives  
(i) To develop a system capable of tracking and analyzing user sentiment in real 
time across multiple platforms.  
 (ii) To implement algorithms to classify user feedback into positive, negative and 
neutral feedback to provide actionable insights for product improvement and 
marketing strategies.  
  (ii) To design the system to handle large volume of data and adapt new platforms, 
languages and evolving customer communication trends.

 CHAPTER TWO: DESIGN AND MODELLING  
2.1 Introduction to Modelling  
User sentiment tracking system use AI and NLP to analyze customer opinions from 
social media, reviews, and surveys. The sources reviewed are not older than 5 years 
in the past as of the time this paper was written (2025) and this ensures that only 
current and reliable data solutions are investigated. APA7 has been used to conduct 
in text citation for this paper and referencing at the end of this paper. The research 
findings shows that modern machine learning models improve accuracy, helping 
brands enhance r eputation, customer satisfaction, and decision making. However, 
challenges like sarcasm detection and fake reviews persist. Advancements in big 
data and AI continue to refine sentiment analysis, making it crucial for brand 
success. The section has the foll owing sub sections, empirical review deals with 
solutions, and conclusion which summarizes the contents of conceptual and 
empirical review.  
2.2 User Interface Model  
 A user sentiment tracking system classifies sentiments as positive, negative or 
neutral helping brands improve reputation, customer engagement and product 
strategy. Key challenges include sarcasm detection, fake reviews and contextual 
misinterpretation. A dvancements in AI and big data analytics continue to refine 
sentiment tracking, making it valuable tool for brand.
