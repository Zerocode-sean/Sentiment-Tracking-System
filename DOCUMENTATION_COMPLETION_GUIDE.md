### **Abstract (Page iii)**
```
Suggested content:

This project presents the development of a comprehensive User Sentiment Tracking System designed to monitor and analyze customer feedback across multiple platforms in real-time. The system employs machine learning algorithms, specifically Logistic Regression with TF-IDF vectorization, to classify user sentiment into positive, negative, and neutral categories with 75-85% accuracy.

The system features a role-based architecture supporting administrators, product managers, and marketing teams with specialized dashboards and reporting capabilities. Key features include automated sentiment analysis, professional PDF report generation, interactive data visualizations, and secure user management.

The implementation utilizes Python, Streamlit, and SQLite for the core architecture, with deployment capabilities on cloud platforms. Testing demonstrates the system's ability to process large datasets (100K+ records) with response times under 2 seconds, making it suitable for enterprise-level sentiment monitoring.

Results show successful achievement of all project objectives, with the system providing actionable insights for product improvement and marketing strategy optimization. The platform is production-ready and has been successfully deployed on Streamlit Cloud for client demonstration.
