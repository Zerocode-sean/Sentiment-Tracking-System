## 🔧 Configuration

### Kaggle API (Optional)

If you want to download datasets from Kaggle:

1. Get your `kaggle.json` from Kaggle account settings
2. Place it in `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`

### Model Training

- Models are automatically trained when admins upload new datasets
- Previous models are versioned and saved
- System tracks model performance metrics

> **⚠️ Important Note**: If this is a fresh clone and no model files exist yet, you'll need to train a model by uploading a dataset through the admin panel. Once trained, model files can be committed to the repository for easier deployment.

### First-Time Setup (Model Training Required)

After cloning and running the app for the first time:

1. **Login as Admin** using credentials: `admin` / `admin123`
2. **Navigate to Admin Panel** → Dataset Management
3. **Upload a CSV dataset** with columns: `text` (feedback) and `sentiment` (positive/negative/neutral)
4. **Click "Process Dataset"** - this will automatically train and save the sentiment model
5. **Model files will be created** and the live sentiment analysis will become available

**Quick Start with Sample Data:**
- Use the included `sample_dataset.csv` file for immediate testing
- This contains 55 labeled examples across positive, negative, and neutral sentiments
- Perfect for getting started and seeing the system in action

**Sample Dataset Format:**
```csv
text,sentiment
"Great product, highly recommend!",positive
"Poor quality, disappointed.",negative
"Average experience, nothing special.",neutral
```

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Local Deployment

```bash
streamlit run src/enhanced_dashboard.py
```

### Cloud Deployment (Streamlit Cloud)

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect to Streamlit Cloud
3. Deploy from `src/enhanced_dashboard.py`

### Docker Deployment (Optional)

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8501
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "src/enhanced_dashboard.py"]
```

## 📈 Performance Notes

- SQLite suitable for development and small-to-medium datasets
- For production with large datasets, consider PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Model accuracy improves with larger, diverse datasets

## 🔒 Security Features

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Role-based access control
- Activity logging
- Session management

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import errors:** Ensure all requirements are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
2. **Database errors:** Check file permissions in data folder
3. **Model training fails:** Verify dataset has `text` and `sentiment` columns
4. **"No trained model found" message:** 
   - This is normal after first clone - model files are not included in repository
   - Upload a dataset through Admin Panel → Dataset Management to train a model
   - Model files (`sentiment_model.joblib`, `tfidf_vectorizer.joblib`) will be created automatically
5. **Live sentiment analysis not working:**
   - Ensure you've trained a model first (see #4 above)
   - Check that both model files exist in the root directory
   - Try restarting the application after training

### Support

- Check logs in the admin panel
- Review user activity for debugging
- System health metrics available to administrators
