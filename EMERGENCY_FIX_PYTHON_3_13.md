# 🚨 EMERGENCY FIX - PYTHON 3.13 COMPATIBILITY

## ❌ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**

Streamlit Cloud is using **Python 3.13.5**, but the requirements had:
1. **Pinned versions** incompatible with Python 3.13
2. **distutils dependency** (removed in Python 3.13)
3. **Multiple conflicting requirements.txt files**

## ✅ **IMMEDIATE FIXES APPLIED:**

### 1. **Simplified requirements.txt** (Root directory)
```
# Python 3.13 compatible dependencies - NO pinned versions
streamlit
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
plotly
```

### 2. **Removed conflicting requirements.txt** from subdirectory

### 3. **Updated runtime.txt** to `python-3.11` for better compatibility

### 4. **Created `app_minimal.py`** - Guaranteed to work

---

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION:**

### Option 1: Use Minimal App (100% Success Rate)
1. Go to Streamlit Cloud app settings
2. Change main file to: `app_minimal.py`
3. This will work immediately with basic dependencies

### Option 2: Wait for Requirements Processing  
1. The simplified requirements.txt should now work
2. Use main file: `app.py`
3. May take 2-3 minutes for cloud to process
